# WME-P2SM
German fork of the no longer supported version of P2SM


The Script initially was created by a WME user, but it seems there have been no updates to the Scripts for a long time.
I looked at the functionality annd found it very useful to edit the map by using references to other maps at the same location.

Digging deeper into details there were some coorditate conversions missing, which are needed to hand over the WME coordinates to other maps.

This has been added by cross-scripting and the whole script has been adjusted to meet the needs of the German community.
